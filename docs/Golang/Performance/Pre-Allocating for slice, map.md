Allocating a slice with a capacity that is suitable for the number of elements it is expected to hold can improve performance in Go.

Here is the benchmark:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Allocate a slice with a small capacity
	start := time.Now()
	s := make([]int, 0, 10)
	for i := 0; i < 100000; i++ {
		s = append(s, i)
	}
	elapsed := time.Since(start)
	fmt.Printf("Slice with small capacity: %v\n", elapsed) // 1.165208ms

	// Allocate a slice with a larger capacity
	start = time.Now()
	s = make([]int, 0, 100000)
	for i := 0; i < 100000; i++ {
		s = append(s, i)
	}
	elapsed = time.Since(start)
	fmt.Printf("Slice with larger capacity: %v\n", elapsed) // 361.333Âµs
}
```

This is because allocating a slice with a larger capacity can reduce the number of times that the slice needs to be resized as elements are added. [See](https://medium.com/@func25/go-secret-slice-a-deep-dive-into-slice-6bd7b0b70ec4)
